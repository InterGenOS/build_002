###  InterGenOS_build_002 linpack_inst - The primary linpack package installation script
###  Written by Christopher 'InterGen' Cork <chris@intergenstudios.com>
###  3/14/2015
#
# - Replicates package directory path structure if needed
# - Symlinks all package files into core file system
# - Logs EVERYTHING
# - (which will be used for all sorts of stuff down the road- ie- 'what provides','uninstall', etc)
# 
# **** TO DO LIST ****
#
# Fix file/symlink existance error checking- not working prior to changing
# initial check to use a 'stat' check- haven't re-checked it since that change. 
# (thinking was that stat would at least show something to check against an empty return- but i'm tired and don't want 
# to read anymore tonight- sorry)
# -NOTE- Luke said 'man test'....   0_o
